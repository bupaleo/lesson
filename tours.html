            The Kel-Tor tract is a small branch of the Kegeti Gorge, which is remarkable for its beautiful mountain lake, located at an altitude of 2,700 meters. The lake is of rubble origin, has no direct flow and goes underground, bursting out of the ground a few kilometers below. Most of the year the lake is frozen, and in the summer the water never gets warmer than 5 degrees Celsius, so it is not suitable for swimming.  </p>
